# Node Classification Experiments 💡

This directory contains the code for both the real-world and synthetic node classification experiments in the respective subfolders.

## Real-World Data 🍄

Experiments are run on various pretrainings using real-world _citation networks_ from [Open Graph Benchmark](https://ogb.stanford.edu). 

The experiment runs can be found [here](https://www.comet.ml/graph-net-experiments/node-classification).

## Synthetic Data 🗿

Experiments are run on generated datasets with community structure. We use [DANCer](https://perso.univ-st-etienne.fr/largeron/DANC_Generator/) to generate the graphs.

The experiment runs can be found [here](https://www.comet.ml/graph-net-experiments/node-classification-synthetic).
