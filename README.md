# GNN Transfer Learning ðŸŽ¡

This repository contains all my code for my MSc Dissertation at Wits University titled:

__How does relational knowledge generalise? An analysis of transfer learning for graph neural networks__.

## Repo structure
```
root
â”‚
â””â”€â”€â”€ Node Classification
â”‚    â””â”€â”€â”€ Real World Data
â”‚       â”‚ *
â”‚    â””â”€â”€â”€ Synthetic Data
â”‚       â”‚ *
â”‚   
â””â”€â”€â”€ Graph Classification
     â””â”€â”€â”€ Real World Data
        â”‚ *
     â””â”€â”€â”€ Synthetic Data
        â”‚ *
```

The repo consist of two contexts: __Node Classifcation__ & __Graph Classifcation__.

Each context contains a set of experiments of __Real World Data__ & __Synthetic Data__.
