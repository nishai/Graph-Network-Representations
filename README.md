# GNN Transfer Learning 🎡

This repository contains all my code for my MSc Dissertation at Wits University titled:

__How does relational knowledge generalise? An analysis of transfer learning for graph neural networks__.

## Repo structure 🧑🏾‍💻
```
root
│
└─── Node Classification
│    └─── Real World Data

└─── Graph Classification
     └─── Real World Data
        │ *
     └─── Synthetic Data
        │ *
```

The repo consist of two contexts: __Node Classification__ & __Graph Classification__.

Each context contains a set of experiments of __Real World Data__ & __Synthetic Data__.

## Comet.ml ☄️

All the individual experimental runs can be found on the [comet.ml page](https://www.comet.ml/graph-net-experiments#projects).

Each experiment is tagged for easy filtering. When viewing the list of all experiments, grouping the experients by tags make browsing easier. To do this: click the _Group by_ button, then type "tags" and select it, then click _Done_. 👍🏽
